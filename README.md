# 3902SprintProject
Welcome to the Legend of Zelda!

In This game, you are Link, a commoner, who is suddenly thrust into a mysterious, magical quest in the kingdom of Hyrule to save the princess, Zelda, from one evil or another.
This early implimentation of the game contains three levels with 6 different enemies.

Directions on how to play:

DISCLAIMER:
Our game is trash and unfinished so if you give us a bad grade, we told you so.
We didnt get to implementing collision so many of our state stuff is tied to keys

Link:
To move link around the map, use w,a,s,d and the arrow keys.
To attack with link's sword, use z.
To damage link, use e.
To pause the game and view the menu press p
Once in the menu use a and d to navigate through your items, then press z to select one.
Press M to show winning screen. (Not Working rn)

Levels:
To rotate through levels, use the right key on your mouse for the next level, and the left key for the previous.
Door collision is not yet implemented but if you use the numpad you can activate room transition animations.
  - numpad 8 goes up, 4 is left, 5 is down, 6 is right

Other:
To quit the game, use q.
To reset the game, use r.

Current Bugs:
Link will be stopped by doors to move, but they currently will not send him to the next room.
Link movement is still a little buggy in general
Hurt link does not collide with any other object in the level.
Link using the sword and objects do not hurt the enemies.
Theme song stacks when reset is called.
Link hitting enemies is still super buggy where collision has link being hit multiple times.
(In other words, our game has a LOT of bugs)

These problems will be fixed in the next sprint.


Backlog:
Collision Detction works but handling still is not fully implemented
Minimap (sprites have been made but not implemented)
Finish implementing more levels
Winning State does not work yet
Items are spawning in a few rooms, however you can't pick them up yet. 
(We weren't expecting our backlog to be this long, but this sprint was super rough and we ran into a lot of problems)
