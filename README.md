Welcome to the Legend of Zelda!

In This game, you are Link, a commoner, who is suddenly thrust into a mysterious, magical quest in the kingdom of Hyrule to save the princess, Zelda, from one evil or another.
This game contains a story mode with three different levels, and an endless mode, with an unlimited number of randomly generated rooms.

To choose which version to play, go to the left for endless mode, and to the right for story mode in the opening room.

Directions on how to play:

Link:
To move link around the map, use w,a,s,d.
To change link's direction without moving link, use the arrow keys
To attack with link's sword, use k.
To damage link, use e.
To pause the game and view the menu press p
Once in the menu use a and d to navigate through your items, then press z to select one.
You can then use l to use the item.

How to win:
In Story Mode: Defeat all of the enemies in your path as you find all three of the triforce pieces.
In Endless Mode: Defeat all of the enemies in your path as you pick up as many Rupees as possible!

To reset the game, use r.

Current Bugs:
Hurt link does not collide with any other object in the level.
Theme song stacks when reset is called.

Backlog:
Winning State does not work yet
Items are spawning in a few rooms, however you can't pick them up yet. 
(We weren't expecting our backlog to be this long, but this sprint was super rough and we ran into a lot of problems)
